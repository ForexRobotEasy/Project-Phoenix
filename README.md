## Wave Analysis and Price Prediction
The program utilizes wave analysis on historical data to identify patterns for predicting future price movements. It analyzes longer periods of time to identify repeating patterns and uses smaller periods for approximation and interpolation of nodal points. The patterns are refined to enhance the accuracy of price predictions. Additionally, an extrapolator is used to make predictions based on three waves of different periods, building a predictive model of price behavior.

## Trading Functions
The program implements various trading functions based on the predicted price movements. It includes buying and selling functions to execute trades. The program also calculates position sizes based on risk management parameters and incorporates stop loss and take profit functions to manage trades. Trailing stop functions are implemented to protect profits and limit losses. The program also includes functions for monitoring and adjusting trading parameters based on market conditions. It provides real-time monitoring of account balance, equity, and available margin. Moreover, it offers functions for logging and analyzing trading results.

## Code Requirements
The code of Project Phoenix adheres to the following requirements:

- Clean, well-organized, and modular code structure
- Appropriate coding conventions and best practices
- Code efficiency and optimization
- Error handling and exception handling mechanisms
- Clear and concise comments to enhance code readability
- Use of appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient processing
- Thorough testing and debugging to ensure functionality and reliability

## Usage
The main function, `OnTick()`, is called on every tick of the forex market. This function is responsible for implementing wave analysis on historical data and executing the trading functions based on the predicted price movements. 

Additionally, several other functions need to be implemented to support the main functionality of Project Phoenix. These functions include wave analysis, buying and selling, position size calculation, stop loss and take profit management, trailing stop functionality, monitoring and adjusting trading parameters, monitoring account balance, equity, and available margin, as well as logging and analyzing trading results.

Please refer to the code comments for further instructions on implementing these functions.
